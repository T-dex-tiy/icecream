    Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?
    Soothe us with sweet lies. You can see how I lived before I met you. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!
    Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Say it in Russian! Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!
    Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute
    What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Ooh, name it after me! Say it in Russian! We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! No, I'm Santa Claus!
    Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.
    Oh right. I forgot about the battle.
    Shut up and get to the point!
    Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
    Bite my shiny metal ass. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! You don't know how to do any of those. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! It must be wonderful. Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't veryâ€¦
    Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.
    File not found.
    I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.
    Oh yeah, good luck with that. She also liked to shut up! A true inspiration for the children. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.
    Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Look, last night was a mistake. I wish! It's a nickel. No, she'll probably make me do it.
